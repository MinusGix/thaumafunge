# Thaumafunge
A very much unfinished roguelike-esque game where you play as a wizard who has to write their spells in a language like Befunge (a 2D esolang!) that literally exists in the world.  
The basic concepts are there, but the systems like temperature and other parts are harder to implement.
(Note: Most of this was done in 2021)
